# Demo: Message Queues

Today's demo is more of an AWS tour and a discussion surrounding how all of their services are interconnected by events and actions triggering other code/services to run.

## Live Coding Demo - Real world pub/sub with AWS

> [`demo/aws`](../demo/aws/README.md)

It's been instructive in the past to showcase what AWS does and how it all works so that students get a handle on what you're about to build for them, as well as why they're about to build something so complex...

These small demos connect to the AWS messaging systems: SNS and SQS.  Those services at amazon are "real" message delivery and queueing systems that form the foundation for how all of AWS works and is wired together.

It does take about :45 minutes to get through. This is a great way to sum up this module during code review on the day following this lab.

# Facilitators Guide: Welcome to Code 401 JavaScript

## Overview

This is the first day of 401 Advanced Javascript.

The first class is traditionally very long and is split evenly between introductions, course mechanics, and the actual coding content.

Be sure to spend as much time as needed today on getting the students fully onboard with how the class works, what your expectations are, etc. Setting them up for success early on is a key component to making this a great course.

### How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
This is the first day of 401. Previously, students will have come through Code 201 and Code 301 and should have a great working idea of how Canvas, Slack, and our internal systems work.

**What are we focusing on today**:
The inner workings and expectations of this course. Focus to be placed on grading, how to turn in a quality lab, etc.

## Learning Objectives

Review the detailed objectives in today's [student-facing readme](../README.md).

## Preparation

- Ensure that your class Canvas is completely ready to go.
- Review the [Kickoff Presentation Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CrJZW7G4NA8UCud69IXa1VFlvJxY18wkEqIMQ1J_vvU/edit#slide=id.g3e5f052c4d_0_3)
- Be fully in touch with your own course mechanics, expectations, flow.

## Lecture Outline

Below is the expected lecture outline and flow. One possible way to present this material is documented in the [example lecture](./LECTURE-EXAMPLE.md) notes.

### TOPIC 1: 401 Kickoff and Introductions (~1 hour)

- **Presentation** (30 min)
  - Generally led by the campus coordinator, the kickoff presentation speaks to campus operations, career coaching overviews, code of conduct, etc.
- **Introductions** (20 min)
  - Following the kickoff presentation, have the students introduce themselves
    - This is a great opportunity to start learning names, create a seating chart, etc.
    - When you introduce yourself, use a polished "60 second pitch" to do so
    - Lighten the mood by having everyone...
      - Talk about where they are from
      - Tell us about their previous career
      - Share a nerdy or fun fact about themselves

### TOPIC 2: Course Mechanics (~1 hour)

- **Why** (5 min)
  - It's important that everyone is on the same page in terms of classroom operations
    - Canvas
    - Schedule
    - Expectations
- **What** (10 min)
  - Our resources
    - Front Row Video Page
    - Class Repository
    - Class Canvas
  - Canvas Operations
  - Submission Expectations and Requirements
- **How** (30 min)
  - Class Repository
    - Students are required to `fork` the repository to have their own editable copy of it
    - Set the `upstream` to the original
    - They can then use `git pull upstream master` to keep in sync.
  - Syllabus review
  - Calendar review
  - Assignment review
    - When are assignments due?
      - Readings: End of day following the lecture to which they are matched
        - Expect them to be done before lecture ("The first time you hear/see these words should not be when I say them")
      - Labs: Prior to the start of the next lecture
      - Code Challenges: Prior to the start of the next lecture
      - Data Structure Core Implementations: Prior to the start of the next class
